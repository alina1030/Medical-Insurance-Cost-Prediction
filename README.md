# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction

Building a predictive system to predict the medical insurance cost given certain features of the beneficiary.

Following are the features/attributes used:

1.age: age of primary beneficiary

2.sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male

3.bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height,
objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9

4.children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents

5.smoker: Smoking

6.region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.

7.charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance

ML model used for prediction is Linear Regression

# Linear Regression

Linear regression is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that computes the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent features. When the number of the independent feature, is 1 then it is known as Univariate Linear regression, and in the case of more than one feature, it is known as multivariate linear regression. The goal of the algorithm is to find the best linear equation that can predict the value of the dependent variable based on the independent variables. The equation provides a straight line that represents the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. The slope of the line indicates how much the dependent variable changes for a unit change in the independent variable(s).

Regression: It predicts the continuous output variables based on the independent input variable. like the prediction of house prices based on different parameters like house age, distance from the main road, location, area, etc.

One of the most important supervised learning tasks is regression. In regression set of records are present with X and Y values and these values are used to learn a function so if you want to predict Y from an unknown X this learned function can be used. In regression we have to find the value of Y, So, a function is required that predicts continuous Y in the case of regression given X as independent features.

Here Y is called a dependent or target variable and X is called an independent variable also known as the predictor of Y.
